# CollaborativeSentiment-RecommenderSystem

## Overview 
-  This repository hosts the codebase for a recommendation system that leverages both collaborative filtering and sentimental analysis. The system suggests personalized recommendations based on user behaviour and sentiment analysis of user interactions.

 
-  The goal of the project is to use various data science and machine learning techniques to comprehend and analyze product reviews. It covers topics like sentiment analysis, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and creating a machine learning model to identify related products.
  
## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries ( pandas,numpy,matplotlib,scikit-learn,scipy,nltk,seaborn,keras,sqlite3)

## Prerequisite

1.	Python
2.	Jupyter notebook or Google colab

## Installation

 For the main installations, where multiple libraries are required, you can create a requirements.txt file to streamline the installation process. This file will contain a list of all the necessary libraries along with their versions:

 requirements.txt:
       plaintext
       Copy code
       pandas==1.3.3
       numpy==1.21.2
       matplotlib==3.4.3
       imbalanced-learn==0.8.0
       scikit-learn==0.24.2
       scipy==1.7.1
       nltk==3.6.3
       seaborn==0.11.2
       wordcloud==1.8.1
       gensim==4.1.2
       keras==2.6.0
       vaderSentiment==3.3.2
       tqdm==4.62.3

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data

 The dataset used for this analysis is available in JSON format. We have used the dataset available at https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html. 

## Code Overview

 The codebase is organized into two main folders, each with a specific focus. The first folder encompasses the entire recommendation process, with three files that perform distinct functions in the overall recommendation system. On the other hand, the second folder is dedicated to sentiment analysis and contains three files. 

 ## Steps 

Step 1: Clone the Code

 git clone https://github.com/fannypatel/CollaborativeSentiment-RecommendationSys.git

Step 2: Download Datasets

 Download the datasets from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html. 

Step 3: Organize Files

 Place all notebook files in the same folder as the cloned repository.

Step 4: Run Code in Jupyter Notebook

 Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code. Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed by using: pip install -r requirements.txt and observe   the results.
